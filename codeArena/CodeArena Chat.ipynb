      "I am an undergrad IT student currently in my 3rd year. My current goal is to make my career in cybersecurity. I am totally invested in learning about smart contracts, but I fear that by doing so, my web2 security skills would be on a halt which I don't want. My only motivation learning about smart contracts is 'money' than bugcrowd/hackerone. What should I do? Should I complete focus on smart contract and make money or focus on web2 security and do this as a sidekick?\n",
      "A1: The focus shouldn’t be on money, but on growing your skillset and knowledge. If that’s the sole reason for learning about Web3, then you should focus on building a strong foundation in Web2 security. You’re still young, make full use of your time to discover what you’re competent at and what interests you more. \n",
      "A2: Only you can answer that question. You know what matters more for you personally. Good money can be made both in Web2 and Web3 if you are good. It seems you still have a very on the surface understanding of both types of security practices. Perhaps you should deepen your knowledge in both until one side \"grabs\" you more than the other. \n",
      "A3: The focus should be on what you enjoy the most. If you like the crypto/finance world, you should focus on that.\n",

       "\"Q: How can I best provide code for a test or proof of concept in my CodeArena submission?\\nA: The best method to provide code for a test or proof of concept in your CodeArena submission depends on various factors such as the length of the code, potential exposure of vulnerabilities, and the complexity of the code's setup. If the code is not too lengthy, you can add it directly to the report under the 'Proof of Concept' section. You can also provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub, along with screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept. \\n\\nIf the proof of concept is too large to be embedded directly or if the code reveals potential vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use a private gist or a private GitHub repo. Some wardens have also added a zip file to the submission. It's important to note, when linking to a GitHub repo, it does not automatically pull in that code snippet to the report.\\n\\nIt is also acceptable to use external platforms like Gist for submitting long proofs of concept. However, when showing places of vulnerability, it's recommended to include both the URL to the repository with the line number and a code block. \\n\\nUnderstanding the markdown code to include GitHub code in report can also be helpful. Here is a link to learn how to include that: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks].\\n\\nRemember, the 'Proof of Concept' section is just one part of your submission. You should also clearly explain the vulnerability and its impact on the protocol/code in the 'Impact' section.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the Code4Arena's submission policy at [https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-policy#how-to-include-a-proof-of-concept].\""
