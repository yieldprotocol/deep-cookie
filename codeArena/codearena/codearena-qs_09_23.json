Given all that is it reasonable to ask the sponsor for deployment scripts/test cases?\nA: When I want to run code to confirm something I write a test for it in their test environment. (I just add a new test case at the end and use their existing test setup that already deployed the contracts.) I agree test environments are helpful but I never look for any deployment scripts.", "What if there is no test environment? How can I test the code in that case?\nA: If there is no test setup in the C4 repo, I check if there is a repo on the sponsor's github that maybe has a test setup. If not, I do what you said, just pull out the code or sometimes even rewrite some parts of the contract such that I can easily test the snippet that I wanted to test.", "Any outlook on when the Yaxis audit report will be on the website?\nA: [No answer provided.]", "What do you do if there is no test environment in the repository?  \nA: You can set up fixtures for certain contract deployments and test them in isolation or test them as an entire unit using eth-brownie.", "Any outlook on when the Yaxis audit report will be on the website? \nA: It's probably going to take a little longer than usual due to a high participation rate. It's likely going to be at least a couple of weeks before it's ready to be awarded.", "How do I get tokens onto rinkeby testnet, in order to use swivel? Is there a faucet or something like that? \nA: Yes, you can use the Rinkeby faucet: https://faucet.rinkeby.io.", "When will the liquidity incentive program go live? \nA: [No answer provided]", "How can I withdraw a contest report? \nA: Yes, the process is the same as described in the docs. But, you can also reach out to @Jay | C4 for assistance.", "Is there an example document for submitting bug findings?\nA: You can look at past submissions on https://code423n4.com/reports. Each of the findings links to a GitHub issue. You can also check out the issues in any repo ending with -findings on the C4 GitHub https://github.com/code-423n4.", "After I submit a finding, do I need to do anything else or just wait until the contest ends and come back and check the results on the website? \nA: After submitting a finding, all you need to do is wait.

Right now there are only 2.\nA: There are conversations ongoing on a lot of them.", "How do I alter the severity of my reported bugs after the closing time of the contest? Do I just do that through the PR itself or do I contact one of the judges?\nA: You can DM the staff and they will pass those changes on to the judge.", "Any update on the report for the Yaxis audit?\nA: It's being worked on but the sponsors will get final say on the publication timing - we want to give them sufficient time to mitigate issues.", "After how much time is the report published?\nA: The average turn around time is about a month, and efforts are being made to decrease that.", "Could someone please add me to the boot finance rooms. I'm on the team and keen to see progress.\nA: Done", "Is the Overlay Protocol contest delayed by 5 days?\nA: Yes, their start date changed to 11/16 at midnight UTC.", "How long do I need to wait to join the boot finance rooms?\nA: You have been added to the boot finance rooms.", "Is the Overlay Protocol contest delayed by 5 days?\nA: Yes, the start date for the Overlay Protocol contest has been changed to 11/16 at midnight UTC.", "If the same vulnerability is found in multiple different components of a codebase, does that count as a duplicate or two separate findings?\nA: In cases like these, it's best to submit two separate findings. It ultimately falls to the judge to decide whether to mark them as duplicates. However, it's important to note that awards are distributed based on individual issues. Multiple items in one submission are just going to count for one submission.", "Are there some best practices regarding formatting code in contest findings? I'm using <code> tags but the code always seems to end up mangled in the repository.\nA: Try using markdown. A code block in markdown is surrounded by ``` on either side.", "What's a good way to submit issues with correct formatting?\nA: Create the issues in a tool like Notion, format it there, and then copy and paste the entire thing when submitting. It will be pasted with all the necessary formatting syntax for markdown.", "Does a 0-Non Critical Finding have any share in the Award Pot? If Yes, how many shares if it's a unique finding?\nA: No, non-critical findings do not have a share in the Award Pot.", "What\u2019s the incentive to report non-critical findings?\nA: Currently, there intentionally isn't an incentive for QA type of submissions.

This is more of a cosmetic issue, and it can be bypassed by renaming the project to start with an alphabetical character.", "What updates are planned for the leaderboard?\nA: One update being considered is the introduction of different timeline views in addition to the current \"all time\" view. This could include a \"last 3 months\" view. However, measuring time for these different views is less straightforward due to the varying speed at which contests move through judging/reporting/announcing stages.", "What are some other ideas for fun stats to surface on the leaderboard?\nA: Some ideas include allowing wardens to collect badges for various achievements, such as being a hero at gas optimizations or repeat appearances as MVP. There could also be seasons for the leaderboard, where each season lasts a set period of time and at the end, everyone on the leaderboard receives an NFT with metadata of their rank, money made, and a cool design.", "How could the duration of a leaderboard season be determined?\nA: One suggestion is to have each season last 4 or 6 months. Another idea is to end the season when someone hits a certain dollar target, making each season a race.", "What is a potentially useful metric to introduce to the leaderboard?\nA: One suggested metric is the average percentage of pool awarded. This would be useful as not all participants engage in every contest, for various reasons like lack of time or contest preference.", "How is the contest awarding process understood, and how is the pot divided among those who submitted valid vulnerabilities?\nA: The process is not explicitly detailed in the chat, however, there is mention of a website doc detailing how risk is estimated, which could play a role in the awarding process. The risk levels range from 0 (Non-critical) to 3 (High risk where assets can be stolen/lost/compromised). More definitive information might be found in the award script repo mentioned.", "What other metrics could be used to measure achievements in contests?\nA: A suggested metric was the average percentage of pool awarded, given that not all participants engage in every contest due to various reasons.", "Can the awarding process and the splitting of the pot among those who submitted valid vulnerabilities be explained in more detail?\nA: The process is detailed in the website's documentation. The levels of risk are defined as follows:\n   - Non-critical: Code style, clarity, syntax, versioning, off-chain monitoring (events etc), exclude gas-optimisations.\n   - Low: Assets are not at risk. State handling, function incorrect as to spec, issues with comments.\n   - Med: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.\n   - High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).", "Where can one find information about the monetary aspects of the awards?\nA: Details about the incentive model and awards can be found at https://docs.code4rena.com/#incentive-model-and-awards", "Has the streaming protocol contest been postponed? \nA: Yes, the contest will be starting on 11/30 as per the website.", "How can one update a submission?\nA: Submissions can be updated by sending a direct message to one of the administrators.", "When can the awards for the fairside contest be expected to be announced?\nA: The timeline is currently unknown.

Alternatively, create an issue on a private repo, drag and drop images there, then grab the markdown snippet with the cdn url.", "How are gas optimizations judged? Do they get equal importance?\nA: Gas optimizations are awarded from a separate award pool that is specified on the C4 website (on each contest's page) and in the contest repo. They're awarded the same way as low risk shares of the main pool. For instance, the #deleted-channel contest that just launched has a $67,500 USDC main award pot and a $7,500 USDC gas optimization award pot.

For example, the #deleted-channel contest that just launched has a $67,500 USDC main award pot and a $7,500 USDC gas optimization award pot. Because they are distributed from a single pot, they are awarded using a simplified version of our award calculation as outlined in the docs: https://docs.code4rena.com/#incentive-model-and-awards.

How does that work with the 10% prize pool? Would the report be upgraded?\nA: It's conceivable it could be upgraded. However, it's important to consider that part of auditing is demonstrating proper theory of how an issue could be exploited. If a warden notices something is 'off' but is unable to articulate why it could lead to loss of funds, the job is only half-done. Without understanding the implications, a developer could very well overlook or deprioritize the issue.", "Should proposed changes in the company go through voting on snapshot?

The rule is mainly to respect the fact that the sponsors\u2019 issues should remain under NDA until they choose to make them public.", "Are enums stored in storage or are they stored in the contract bytecode?\nA: Enums are a user-defined type in Solidity. They take up a byte and extra bytecode is added to ensure the size is right for casts. If you're storing an enum it'll take up part of a slot. If you're using it as a literal, it'll be the same as a uint8. Casts will add some overhead.", "Any news about the LPT reward?\nA: No answer provided.", "How do I register a group?\nA: There's information on registering a team in the documentation.

If the sponsors don\u2019t do their part, it makes the judging task much harder.", "How far in advance do contests get announced? Is the first one to find the vulnerabilities the only one to get the payout for that one?

If I buy high amount of tokens there maybe high price impact, which can remove/reduce profit. How to buy right amount of tokens to get max profit? Maybe some formula?\nA: It depends on the AMM. But if you want to do it without doing the math, you can do this: \n1 - Check how much y amount of B you would get by inputting x amount of A when doing swap A -> \u2026 -> B.\n2- Check how much z amount of A you would get by inputting y amount of B when doing swap B -> \u2026 -> A.\nYou can get these values through the getAmountsOut function of UNI-v2 router.

So I try to understand how to get optimal amount of asset A to get max profit.\nA: Ignoring protocol fees, the core UniswapV2 swap formula is (x + dx) * (y - dy) = x * y, where: \nx is the initial amount (reserve) of tokenA, \ny is the initial amount (reserve) of tokenB, \ndx is the tokenA amount you input, and dy is the tokenB amount you receive.\nYou want to input just enough dx such that (y - dy) / (x + dx) is lowered to the fair market value. We can use a to represent that ratio. Now we have all we need to solve the problem. Here's the formula you can use:\ndx = (-2x + sqrt(x * y / a)) / 2\n= -x + sqrt(x * y / a)\nThis ignores the protocol fee. But you can probably get away with just using 1% less dx to not bother with that math. Also, if you get a negative result, then it means that the initial x / y ratio is already below a.", "How to buy the right amount of tokens to get maximum profit? Maybe some formula?\nA: It depends on the Automated Market Maker (AMM). In general, you can derive it from the AMM's price formula. If you don't want to do the math, you can check how much of token B you would get by inputting a certain amount of token A when doing a swap, and then check how much of token A you would get by inputting that amount of token B when doing the reverse swap. To find the optimal value you can use a simple algorithm.", "What is the simple algorithm for finding the optimal value of tokens to swap?\nA: The algorithm is explained through a series of mathematical formulae. It relies on the core UniswapV2 swap formula and involves solving for the amount of token A you input and the amount of token B you receive. The goal is to input just enough of token A such that the ratio of token B to token A is lowered to the fair market value. The final result is a quadratic formula that can be solved for the input amount of token A.", "What about multiple token swap arbitrage, like A -> B1 -> B2 -> A?

E.g.: one uint256 = one slot, but you can also pack 4 uint64s into one slot if they are declared next to each other. The bool here is one byte, but takes up a whole storage slot because the next uint256 can't fit in. If the bool were next to an address (address is only 20 bytes) it would fit in one slot. The GSSET opcode is used to set the value of a storage slot (when the storage value is set to non-zero from zero). If a function were to modify the bool and the address it only has to call the opcode GSSET once, reducing gas costs. 2. - One-step change with critical addresses could leave an error where you pass in the wrong address.
