**1. Why should auditors bother to put more than one Low findings in QA if all As get the same award, no matter how many Low findings there are?**

Judges look at both quantity and quality when judging QA reports. If a warden's QA submission only had 1 item, it would be pretty unlikely to receive a high grade. Especially if other wardens' QA submissions within that audit contained many high-quality items in comparison. More information can be found at https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria#qa-reports-low-non-critical and https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#qa-and-gas-optimization-reports.

**2. If I found a Medium issue and judges evaluate it as Low instead, would that Low be transferred into my QA report?**

Judges have the ability to downgrade medium issues to QA and consider them alongside your QA report when grading. They also have the ability to upgrade items from your QA report if they feel severity should be higher and that your details are thorough enough. Both of these would be the judges decision to make.

**23. If I have a limited time for audit, and I've just spotted 1-2 Low and 1-2 Gas issues, is it worth to create a report for them? Or, because of just 1-2 issues, will they always be graded as C?**

Grading is determined by other reports, i.e., compared to other highly ranked reports yours might not cut it. Your gas report has a very high likelihood of being a C. For the lows, maybe you can find a way of making it a medium.
