        "question": "Why should auditors bother to put more than one Low findings in QA if all As get the same award, no matter how many Low findings there are?",
        "answer": "Judges look at both quantity and quality when judging QA reports. If a warden's QA submission only had 1 item, it would be pretty unlikely to receive a high grade. Especially if other wardens' QA submissions within that audit contained many high-quality items in comparison. More information can be found at https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria#qa-reports-low-non-critical and https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#qa-and-gas-optimization-reports.",

        "question": "If I found a Medium issue and judges evaluate it as Low instead, would that Low be transferred into my QA report?",
        "answer": "Judges have the ability to downgrade medium issues to QA and consider them alongside your QA report when grading. They also have the ability to upgrade items from your QA report if they feel severity should be higher and that your details are thorough enough. Both of these would be the judges decision to make.",
