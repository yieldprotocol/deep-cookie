Or how\nmature the codebase is?\n\n|\n\n **Low-hanging fruit.** If a project is seeking an audit, it's likely fresh\ncode with clear opportunities to dig in.  \n  \n **Grow on your own.** Researchers have to proactively look for ways to learn\nand level up their skills.\n\n|\n\n **Learning community.** Open, competitive audits let auditors compare\neveryone's findings and learn new things every single week.  \n  \n **Paradox of choice.** So many projects have bounties. How does an auditor\nchoose which to focus on?\n\n|\n\n **Less FOMO.** C4 runs a handful of active audits at a time and wardens can\nRSVP to signal to each other which audits have more participants.  \n  \n###\n\nTraditional audits vs C4 audits\n\nTraditional audits\n\n|\n\nC4 audits  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n **Constrained time.** If you want a quality audit from a top firm, you're\ngoing to have to wait.\n\n|\n\n **Time flexible.** Code audits can be put together quickly for teams eager to\ngo to market.  \n  \n **Constrained cost.** Audit firms must recruit and retain talent, and\ndefensively maintain their brand.\n\n|\n\n **Flexible cost.** C4 scales to meet demand. Sponsors can increase pot size\nto attract more attention.  \n  \n **Constrained diversity.** Audit firm staff have to work to stay ahead of\nDeFi's complex and expanding attack surface.\n\n|\n\n **Diverse capability.** C4 audits allow specialized security researchers to\ndemonstrate their skill and creativity.  \n  \n **Systematic.** Firms use set processes for evaluating code, which differs\nfrom the way attackers approach things.\n\n|\n\n **Rigorous.** C4 wardens are incentivized to work creatively to find as many\nrare, high risk vulnerabilities as possible.  \n  \n##\n\nIncentive model and awards\n\nDetails on Code4rena's incentive model and awards can now be found\n[here](/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards).\n\n[Next \\- RolesWardens](/roles/wardens)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nBug bounties vs C4 audits\n\nTraditional audits vs C4 audits\n\nIncentive model and awards\n\n"}
