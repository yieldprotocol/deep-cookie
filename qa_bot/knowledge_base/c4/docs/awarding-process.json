Judges evaluate input from\nboth and make the ultimate decision in terms of severity and validity of\nissues. (See [How to judge an audit](/roles/judges/how-to-judge-a-contest) for\nmore detail.)\n\nIn making their determination, judges add labels to Github issues, while the\noriginal submission data (including the warden's proposed severity rating) is\npreserved via a JSON data file.\n\nThe judge's decisions are reviewed by the sponsoring project team and by\n[+backstage wardens](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-\ncontributors/backstage-wardens) via a 48-hour QA process, to ensure fairness\nand quality.\n\nJudging data is used to generate the awards using Code4rena's award\ncalculation script, which factors in:\n\n  * Risk level\n\n  * Validity\n\n  * Number of duplicates\n\n  * Grade (A, B, C; Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory)\n\n  * In some cases, \"partial duplicate\" status\n\nIt should be possible to reverse engineer awards using a combination of two\nCSV files:\n\n  * \u200b[`findings.csv`](https://code4rena.com/community-resources/findings.csv): valid Code4rena findings\n\n  * \u200b[`contests.csv`](https://code4rena.com/community-resources/contests.csv): Code4rena audits\n\nOnce awards are determined, we generate a CSV file enumerating funds to be\nsent. Distribution is then initiated using disperse.app and sent to multisig\nsigners for completion of payment.\n\n###\n\nIf you don't see your award in your wallet:\n\nFor most Code4rena contests, awards are sent on the Polygon network (usually\nin USDC) within 1-2 weeks of the awards announcement.\n\nIf awards have been sent, and you don't see them in your wallet, please verify\nthat you have imported the USDC token into your Polygon wallet. (MetaMask\ninstructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-\nus/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask).)\n\nIf you still don't see the award in your wallet, please [open a help desk\nticket](https://code4rena.com/help).\n\n##\n\nTax and legal questions\n\n>  _Note: Do your own research; this is not legal or tax advice. You should\n> consult a professional in your area._\n\nWe are occasionally asked how wardens should declare Code4rena earnings for\ntax (or other financial/legal) purposes. Due to the nascent nature of DAOs, we\nare unable to provide reliable information in this area. You must assess and\ndetermine your own best course of action.\n\nAudit contest rewards are distributed by the DAO, which does not have a legal\npersonality.\n\nThe DAO has designated Code4rena Foundation as its agent via [a governance\naction](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/13) [approved by DAO\nmembers](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x8fbe178e34a7ae03a5e0d1f49f23e38f3a1c0d1186a67920d33196a89f79da98)\nfor purposes of entering into contractual agreements. However, wardens are not\nin any contractual agreement with the Foundation [unless they are\ncertified](https://code4rena.com/certified-contributor-summary/).\n\n\u200b[Documentation of Code4rena Foundation can be found\nhere.](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/tree/main/foundation)\u200b\n\nCode4rena Foundation may or may not be able to provide further information;\ntheir contact information is below.\n\nCode4rena Foundation\n\n\u200b[Campbell Law](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#55363438253730393915263c39233027263c313038343b34323038303b217b3e2c)\u200b\n\nP.O.
