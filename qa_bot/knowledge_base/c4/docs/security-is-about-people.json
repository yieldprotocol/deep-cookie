Emotions and the way we handle them impact the\nsecurity of a project as much or perhaps more than any other contributing\nfactor.\n\nThough almost no one will admit it, everyone's carrying around a lot of\nemotion when it comes to security. These feelings strongly affect the way\npeople approach security even though most people never show them.\n\nLike software vulnerabilities, there are no flags waving and red lights\nblaring. These feelings are buried deep and never raise their head above the\nsurface--but they're ever present.\n\n###\n\nFear and shame drive security\n\n  * Developers fear they'll be publicly embarrassed by a hack.\n\n  * Auditors worry they'll miss something that gets exploited.\n\nIn the world of DeFi, the emotional intensity of this fear is even greater. A\nhigh-profile hack could mean not only friends losing money, but also getting\npiled on by the mob of speculators wanting token prices to go \"up only\".\n\nThese fears lead people to approach security in a way that is less productive\nand effective than it could be, leading projects to focus on security theater,\nimage management, and trying to turn audits into proof of a project's security\nso that blame can be swiftly assigned.\n\nBut security doesn't work that way. Top audit teams and well respected\ndevelopers have had their contracts exploited. Security is a process not a\ndestination, and that's even more true in a bleeding edge domain like DeFi.\n\n###\n\nWe can do better\n\nWe aim to reduce the fear and shame driven approach and replace it with a\nhealthier one_,_ which starts with recognizing what an emotionally challenging\ntask it is to secure code.\n\n>  _It is not the critic who counts; not the one who points out... where the\n> doer of deeds could have done them better._ ** _The credit belongs to the\n> one who is actually in the arena_** _... who errs, who comes short again and\n> again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming._ --Teddy\n> Roosevelt\n\nWe think of _everyone--_auditors, developers--as playing their role together\nin the arena, with the ultimate goal being to level up smart contract security\nwhile reducing the pressure and burden on individual people.\n\nWhile we use a competitive arena to add a dimension of fun and an incentive to\nstrive for the best work we can each uniquely contribute, we strongly believe\n**security is a collaborative, community effort.**\n\n##\n\nSecurity is about people\n\nFear and shame are powerful motivators, but they are unsustainable, short-\nsighted, and redirect attention to appearance rather than substance.\n\nIt may not be \"logical\" for humans to act in emotional ways, but humans are\nindeed emotional beings. Rather than arguing against reality, we should\nacknowledge this and work with it. As one of C4's bootstrappers, Scott Lewis,\nput it:\n\n> \"The way all human brains work is not silly. We should change technology for\n> humans, not change humans for technology.\"\n\nWe believe the same is true for both our approach to [building C4 as an\norganization](/philosophy/how-we-work) and the way we view security.\n\n###\n\nGetting an audit is courageous\n\nAn audit is an investment in a better long-term outcome for both the project\nundergoing the audit as well as its users and the community as a whole.\n\nIt requires tremendous courage to ask someone to look closely and find as many\nplaces where code could be improved.\n\nBecause of this, we treat sponsor projects with respect. We consider every\nfinding discovered in an audit contest as a tool that we can use in the future\nto help others learn and better understand smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\n###\n\nBoth wardens and sponsors have a voice in the process\n\nWe take sponsors' feelings into consideration, working to help find ways to\ncommunicate and disclose the results of audits in a way that works as best as\nwe can to eliminate the \"blame and shame\" approach and replace it with one\nthat honors sponsors' contribution toward making their project and the DeFi\nspace more secure for everyone.\n\nOur contest process is transparent, with all issues reviewable on GitHub. We\nput an impartial judge in the position of listening to all players' positions\non a given issue and making a final determination.\n\n###\n\nWe are a community\n\nWe trust that a community-driven approach with valuable incentives ensures\nenough coverage to give sponsors a meaningful and valuable audit without\nputting the burden on any one person to do a 'good enough job' catching every\nbug--a burden that burns out traditional auditors.\n\nOur community chose the wolf as our symbol, and it's fitting. Wolves are\nhighly collaborative creatures who hunt in packs.\n\nRather than putting the pressure on individual auditors to catch all the\nvulnerabilities in a project, we ask competitors to catch the bugs that they\ncan, and trust that the community will show up and contribute.\n\n[Awarding - PreviousFairness and validity](/awarding/fairness-and-\nvalidity)[Next \\- PhilosophyThe culture we're building](/philosophy/how-we-\nwork)\n\nLast modified 1yr ago\n\nOn this page\n\nFear and shame drive security\n\nWe can do better\n\nSecurity is about people\n\nGetting an audit is courageous\n\nBoth wardens and sponsors have a voice in the process\n\nWe are a community\n\n"}
