In the\ninterest of impartiality, they must forgo any awards they would have received\nfor their own submissions as wardens. Therefore, the role is typically\nassigned prior to the competition's start.\n\n##\n\n **Becoming a Lookout**\n\nTo become a Lookout, you may be nominated by a Judge or Lookout in good\nstanding, or nominate yourself.\n\n####\n\n **Minimum criteria**\n\n  * Compete in at least 3 Code4rena audits;\n\n  * Be a [Certified C4 contributor](/roles/certified-contributors) in good standing;\n\n  * Find at least 1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings OR score A on at least 3 QA or Gas reports;\n\n####\n\n **Non-technical criteria**\n\n  *  **Sense of fairness** --i.e. evidence suggests you don't show favoritism, but instead aim for a fair competition where quality is rewarded.\n\n  *  **Clear written communication** --your English does not need to be perfect, but you should be able to engage in technical discussions with judges and sponsors via written English.\n\n##\n\nHow to apply\n\nComplete [this application form](https://code4rena.com/lookout-application/)\nand share:\n\n  * Short bio/intro and summary of relevant experience\n\n  * Links that help demonstrate your expertise\n\n  * 3 example submissions to Code4rena audits that you're especially proud of\n\n  * Description of how each submission demonstrates your depth of knowledge\n\n **Note:** Lookout applications are reviewed during a one-week period each\nmonth. Notices of application and review windows will be posted in the C4\nDiscord server.\n\n **Lookout selection process**\n\nBeing a lookout is a critical role and we only have so many spots.\n\nLookout applications are reviewed monthly by a group of C4 judges and\nlookouts. The group will review your application and give you a \"yes\" or \"not\nyet\".\n\n[Previous+Backstage wardens](/roles/certified-contributors/backstage-\nwardens)[Next \\- AwardingIncentive model and awards](/awarding/incentive-\nmodel-and-awards)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nLookouts\n\nBecoming a Lookout\n\nHow to apply\n\n"}
