Excludes Gas optimizations, which are submitted and judged separately.\n\n  *  **2 -- Med:** Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.\n\n  *  **3 -- High:** Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).\n\n###\n\nSeverity Standardization Process\n\nJudges and the C4 community collaborate in open discussions of severity\nstandards, which has created an evolving meta that's unique to C4 and enables\nboth the organizations being audited and the auditors themselves to be part of\na platform that is self-reflective and is constantly iterating on its\nprocesses for their collective benefit.\n\nThe rules above act as a starting point, and these open discussions act as a\ngrowing set of case law examples. You can view the open forum where these\ndiscussions are held\n[here](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arules).\n\n[Awarding - PreviousJudging criteria](/awarding/judging-criteria)[Next \\-\nAwardingFairness and validity](/awarding/fairness-and-validity)\n\nLast modified 6mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nEstimating Risk\n\nSeverity Standardization Process\n\n"}
