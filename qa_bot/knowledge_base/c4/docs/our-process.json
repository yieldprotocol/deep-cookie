We have an\nincreasingly detailed operational manual in Notion.\n\nWe are working on tightening up all of our processes in order to be able to\ndistribute awards and publish reports more quickly. Here's our estimated\ntimeline:\n\nText\n\n|\n\nIdeal\n\n|\n\nActual (on average)  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAudit submissions close\n\n|\n\nDay 1\n\n|\n\nDay 1  \n  \nLookout pre-sorts findings (de-duping and triage)\n\n|\n\nDay 7\n\n|\n\nDay 7  \n  \nSponsors review and give feedback on findings\n\n|\n\nDay 9\n\n|\n\nDay 14  \n  \nJudges determine final severity\n\n|\n\nDay 12\n\n|\n\nDay 21-30  \n  \nJudging QA complete; awards announced\n\n|\n\nDay 15\n\n|\n\nDay 25-34  \n  \nAwards are distributed; Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues\n\n|\n\nDay 15\n\n|\n\nDay 32-44  \n  \nAudit report is published; Audit issues are made public\n\n|\n\nDay 21\n\n|\n\nDay 42-60  \n  \nPresently, the process takes us longer than the ideal, but we are actively\nworking to improve our planning and processes that will smooth out the rough\nspots that slow things down.\n\nSee also: [Awarding process](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-\nmodel-and-awards/awarding-process)\u200b\n\n[Other Details - PreviousFAQ](/structure/frequently-asked-questions)[Next \\-\nOther DetailsWhere can I find\u2026?](/structure/where-can-i-find...)\n\nLast modified 20d ago\n\n"}
