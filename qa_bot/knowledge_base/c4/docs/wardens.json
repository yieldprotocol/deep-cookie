[Apply using this\nform](https://code4rena.com/register/), then pop into Discord and give us a\nhowl in `#`[`i-want-to-be-a-warden`](https://discord.gg/pmGC2gH9Mg).\n\nOnce you've completed those steps and been approved, [have a look at the C4\nwebsite](https://code4rena.com), where you'll find a list of open and upcoming\naudits, along with their pot size, start and end date, and other relevant\ninformation. Active audits will typically include a link to the code repo, as\nwell as the submission form for findings.\n\nAs a reminder, for Wardens participating in code audits, please familiarize\nyourself with the [submission policy](/roles/wardens/submission-policy) and\n[judging criteria](/awarding/judging-criteria) prior to participating.\n\n###\n\nRegistering a team\n\nTo register a team, you must first register your individual warden handles,\nand then register your team [here](https://code4rena.com/register/team/).\n\nOnce a team is created, you have the ability to add/remove members and update\nyour payment address while logged in to the Code4rena website.\n\nAll team registrations and updates will create pull requests that are flagged\nfor the C4 team to review and approve. Please allow 24-48 business hours for\nprocessing.\n\n\u2757\ufe0f **Important note: Team awards are sent as a single payment to** ** _one_**\n**wallet.** We strongly recommend using a multisig wallet, or a tool like\n[PaymentSplitter](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/finance#PaymentSplitter),\nto distribute awards among your team members. Note that C4 does not track\nwhich team member submitted each finding; your team is responsible for keeping\ntrack of that information, and distributing awards. The team structure at C4\nis designed so that you submit as a team and get paid as a team.\n\n###\n\nAudit timeline\n\n  *  **Most audits run for 3-7 days,** and typically start and end at 20:00 UTC.\n\n  * The rest of our audit timeline is documented on the [Audit timeline](/structure/our-process) page.\n\n###\n\nQuestions?\n\nWhen audit sponsors come to Code4rena for an audit, we always encourage them\nto provide documentation, and to make themselves available for questions, so\nthey get the most out of their audit.\n\nWhen a sponsor designates a team member who is available for questions, that\nperson will introduce themselves in the C4 Discord (in a audit-specific\nchannel), and we recommend contacting them via DM with any questions you may\nhave.\n\n###\n\n\u23e9 TL;DR\n\n  * Turn in your reports before the audit end time.\n\n  * For each audit, submit your Medium and High risk findings individually.\n\n  * Bundle all of your low-risk and non-critical findings into a _single_ QA report.\n\n  * Similarly, list _all_ of your gas optimizations together in a single Gas report.\n\n  * Be sure to [register your handle and Polygon address](https://code4rena.com/register/) to receive your share.\n\n  * Publicly disclosing (e.g. publishing or discussing) any discovered bugs or vulnerabilities before the audit report has been published is grounds for disqualification from all C4 events.\n\n[PreviousCode4rena](/)[NextSubmission policy](/roles/wardens/submission-\npolicy)\n\nLast modified 3d ago\n\nOn this page\n\nJoining an audit\n\nRegistering a team\n\nAudit timeline\n\nQuestions?\n\n\u23e9 TL;DR\n\n"}
