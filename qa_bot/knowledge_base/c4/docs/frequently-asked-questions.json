Built by a team of leading industry experts, Code4rena is designed to\nprotect your project and community by providing access to the best security\nresearchers and smart contract experts in the world.\n\n###\n\nHow is Code4rena different from other audit companies?\n\nAt Code4rena, we live by the motto \"[the more eyes on the code, the more bugs\nfound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1rKwDv5kLQ)\". By harnessing the power\nof the Code4rena community, projects have access to unmatched value when\nconsidering engineer hours of code review.\n\nOur platform is designed to incentivize everyone to participate in finding\nvulnerabilities. In contrast to other audit companies or bug bounty\nfacilitators, there isn't a race to find the biggest one as fast as possible.\nEveryone who puts in the effort and finds something valid will be rewarded,\nthereby increasing participation levels and the scope of vulnerabilities\nfound.\n\n###\n\nCan anyone participate?\n\nIn short, yes! Anyone can become a Code4rena Warden, and plenty of resources\nare available to learn more and earn rewards. You can find out more about this\nin our [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena).\n\n###\n\nWhat's the difference between Wardens and Masons?\n\nThe simplest way to define the difference between Wardens and Masons is this:\nWardens contribute to the ecosystem by auditing code and identifying\nvulnerabilities, while Masons leverage unique skills outside of auditing to\ncontribute. Examples of Mason contributions could include things like\nexplainer videos, blogs, mentorship programs etc.\n\n###\n\nHow do I sign up to be a Warden?\n\nJump into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena) and get started! From\nthere, you'll need to [register](https://code4rena.com/register) as a Warden,\nthen say hi in our #i-want-to-be-a-warden Discord channel.\n\n###\n\nHow can I become a Judge?\n\nComplete [this form](https://code4rena.com/judge-application/) and share:\nShort bio/intro and summary of relevant experience, links that help\ndemonstrate your expertise, 3 example submissions to Code4rena contests that\nwere judged high severity, description of how each submission demonstrates\nyour depth of knowledge.\n\n###\n\nHow can I become a Scout?\n\nYou can't, just yet! Right now, Scouts are hand-picked by the C4 team as it's\na highly sensitive role. We're looking at the possibility of opening up this\nprocess, but not in the near future.\n\n###\n\nI want Code4rena to audit my project, where do I start?\n\nIt's really simple! Just visit [this\nlink](https://code4rena.typeform.com/i-want-an-audit) and fill out the form.\nOur team will be in touch with you shortly after you've completed it.\n\n###\n\nDo you have a blog?\n\nWe do indeed, [here](https://medium.com/code-423n4). We post product updates,\nsponsor interviews and more.\n\n###\n\nWhat's the best way to stay up to date with Code4rena?\n\n\u200b[Follow us](https://twitter.com/code4rena) on Twitter and turn on\nnotifications in our #announcements channel in\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/code4rena).\n\n###\n\nWhere can I view the audit results?\n\nOnce an audit's results have been finalized, they'll be shared in our\n#announcements channel in Discord. The audit's page in the\n'[Audits](https://code4rena.com/contests)' section on our website will also be\nupdated to show results.\n\n###\n\nWhere can I read past Code4rena audit reports?\n\nWe push all public audit reports to the\n'[Reports](https://code4rena.com/reports)' section on our website. This\nenables you to read through past findings, evaluate commonalities, and\ncontinue your learning journey. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/code-423n4/)\nrepos are also public, for those of you interested in diving deeper.\n\n###\n\nHow are audits judged?\n\nWe have a lot of documents outlining the technicalities of our judging\nprocess, which you can view\n[here](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/judges/how-to-judge-a-contest). In\nshort, Judges follow stringent criteria, whilst making sure submissions adhere\nto C4 policies. We've also implemented a severity standardization guide to\nensure a homogenized approach.\n\n##\n\nWarden FAQ\n\n###\n\nHow do I submit issues to an audit?\n\nSimply navigate to the audit page, click on the `Submit Findings` button, and\nfill out the form with your findings. Make sure to validate your wallet\naddress beforehand.\n\n###\n\nHow can I confirm that Code4rena has received my finding?\n\nSimply head over to the specific audit page and navigate to the `Findings`\ntab. If you see your issue listed, then it is already received by the C4 team.\n\nYou should also receive an email confirmation from [[email protected]](/cdn-\ncgi/l/email-protection) (If you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam\nfolder.)\n\n###\n\nI submitted a finding but then realized it was invalid. Do I need to contact\nCode4rena?\n\nYou can go to the `Findings` tab on the audit page and open the specific\nfinding. There you will see an option to `Withdraw` the finding.\n\n###\n\nCan I edit my findings post-submission?\n\nYes! Go to the `Findings` tab on the audit page and open the concerned\nfinding, make edits and submit changes. This option is only available until\nthe audit deadline, though.\n\n###\n\nWhat if I want to change my wallet address?\n\nYou can change your payment information at any time. Simply log in and go to\n[your account management page](https://code4rena.com/account).\n\nNote: for each audit, C4 distributes awards to the payment address on file _at\nthe time of award calculation_.\n\n###\n\nWhy was my finding marked as invalid?\n\nThe validity of an audit report submission is not based on whether it is\n'true' or not. A report may contain a finding which is factually 'true' (the\nmost literal interpretation of 'valid'), but if it does not add value or if it\nis not presented in such a way that adds value to a sponsor, it may be deemed\ninvalid by a judge.\n\n###\n\nWhy was my finding downgraded from the severity I gave it?\n\nExplaining and rationalizing the potential impact is an essential part of a\nquality submission. The burden of proof increases based on the potential value\nof the submission (rarity, severity). Judges will refer to the criteria on\n[this page](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria#estimating-\nrisk-tl-dr) to ascertain whether a finding matches the severity a warden has\ninitially given it.\n\n###\n\nDo Judges have the final say?\n\nThey do. Judges review findings and sponsor input, and come to their own\nindependent conclusion in alignment with our criteria. Doing this ensures the\nimpartiality of the process. You can read more about our approach to this\n[here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria).\n\n###\n\nIs the judging criteria set in stone, or does it change?\n\nWe're an organization that aims to refine our processes wherever and whenever\npossible. At present, there is [this\npage](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues) on our GitHub to discuss open\nissues in regards to judging standardization.\n\n###\n\nIf I've got questions about the severity I should assign to a finding, where\nshould I go?\n\nIn the C4 Discord, these types of questions are commonly asked in #questions\nand/or #wardens.\n\n[Philosophy - PreviousIntentionally structured](/philosophy/intentionally-\nstructured)[Next \\- Other DetailsAudit timeline](/structure/our-process)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nWhat is Code4rena?\n\nHow is Code4rena different from other audit companies?\n\nCan anyone participate?\n\nWhat's the difference between Wardens and Masons?\n\nHow do I sign up to be a Warden?\n\nHow can I become a Judge?\n\nHow can I become a Scout?\n\nI want Code4rena to audit my project, where do I start?\n\nDo you have a blog?\n\nWhat's the best way to stay up to date with Code4rena?\n\nWhere can I view the audit results?\n\nWhere can I read past Code4rena audit reports?\n\nHow are audits judged?\n\nWarden FAQ\n\nHow do I submit issues to an audit?\n\nHow can I confirm that Code4rena has received my finding?\n\nI submitted a finding but then realized it was invalid.
