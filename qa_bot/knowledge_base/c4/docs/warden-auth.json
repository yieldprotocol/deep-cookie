After you\nregister you can have the option to log in with either your wallet or your\nusername and password.\n\nIf you have and existing Code4rena username, you can re-register your warden\nhandle at https://code4rena.com/ by connecting your wallet from the \"connect\"\ndropdown.\n\n##\n\nAuthenticate with username and password\n\nIf you're a new warden, you can choose to sign up with a username and password\nonly. **If you choose this option, you won't be able to link a wallet to your\naccount for authentication purposes later.**\n\n##\n\nHow to connect your wallet and submit findings\n\n  * Go to https://code4rena.com/ and hover over the \"connect\" dropdown.\n\n  * Choose whether to connect with MetaMask or WalletConnect, or sign up with just a username and password.\n\n  * If you were a registered warden and submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, you need to connect your wallet. Make sure to connect with an address you've used previously to receive earnings from code4rena audits prior to May 25, 2022.\n\n  * Follow the prompts to connect your C4 username with your wallet.\n\n  * Check your email for further instructions.\n\n##\n\nOnce your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:\n\n  * Sign in with the same method you used to register.\n\n  * Proceed to the audit of your choice and submit a finding as usual.\n\n##\n\nTeams\n\nOnce individual team members are authenticated, they will be able to submit\nfindings as individuals or on behalf of the team.\n\n##\n\nFAQ / Troubleshooting\n\n###\n\n **If you were a registered warden prior to June 28, 2022 and you see this\nerror when you fill out the registration form:**\n\n`[your handle] is already a registered username`\n\nIf you submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, please choose either\nMetaMask or WalletConnect from the \"connect\" dropdown.\n\n  1. 1.\n\nIf you did that and ended up on the registration page, please make sure you\nconnect with a wallet address you've used for a Code4rena contest prior to May\n25, 2022.\n\n  2. 2.\n\nIf that doesn't work, please [submit a Help Desk\nrequest](https://code4rena.com/help/).\n\n###\n\n **If your registration was merged but you still can't log in:**\n\nIf you registered with a wallet, make sure you are authenticating with the\nsame address you used when you registered.\n\nIf that doesn't work, please [submit a Help Desk\nrequest](https://code4rena.com/help/).\n\n###\n\n **If you previously submitted findings, but your wallet is not supported by\nWalletConnect:**\n\nThe best solution here is for you to import your wallet to either MetaMask, or\nanother wallet app that is supported by WalletConnect.\n\nIf you can't do that, then [submit a Help Desk\nrequest](https://code4rena.com/help/) and C4 staff will help you get your\naccount registered.\n\n###\n\n **Can I change the wallet address where I receive awards?**\n\nYou can change your payment information any time. Simply log in and go to\n[your account management page](https://code4rena.com/account).\n\nNote: for each contest, C4 distributes awards to the payment address on file\n_at the time of award calculation_.\n\n###\n\n **Can I change the wallet address I log in with?**\n\nUnfortunately due to some restrictions in Moralis, changing addresses is not\ncurrently supported as well as we'd like it to be in the future. There is one\nexception: if you use MetaMask, you can link multiple addresses to your C4\naccount.\n\nHowever, **it 's critical that you do not try to log in with the new address\nthat you want to link before you link it.** Attempting to connect while signed\nin to the new MetaMask address you want to connect will create a new user\nobject. That new user object will block your ability to associate that address\nwith your C4 account. Please watch the video below for details.\n\nTo link multiple addresses in MetaMask, please follow the instructions in this\nvideo:\n\nLinking Wallets with MetaMask (works only with MetaMask)\n\n###\n\n **Can I change my login method after I register?**\n\nIf you registered with your wallet, you can have the option to log in with\neither your wallet or your username and password.\n\nIf you registered prior to October 5, 2022, you can set your password by going\nto your [account management page](https://code4rena.com/account) and clicking\non the \"reset password\" button. This will send you an email with a password\nreset link. After you set your password, you can log in with your c4 username\nand password immediately.\n\nIf you registered with only a password and not a wallet, you will only be able\nto log in with your username and password.\n\n###\n\n **What if my wallet was hacked?**\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n  1. 1.\n\nIf you are not logged in and you haven't set up your password yet, click \"Log\nin\" from the connect dropdown and then click \"forgot password\" to get a\npassword reset link\n\n  2. 2.\n\nLog in with your username and password\n\n  3. 3.\n\nUpdate your payment addresses from the account page\n\n  4. 4.\n\nSubmit a help request through our [Help Desk](https://code4rena.com/help/)\nwhile logged in so that we can remove the hacked wallet from your account.\n\n[PreviousSolo audits](/roles/wardens/solo-audits)[NextTools and\nresources](/roles/wardens/tools-and-resources)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nAuthenticate with your wallet\n\nAuthenticate with username and password\n\nHow to connect your wallet and submit findings\n\nOnce your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:\n\nTeams\n\nFAQ / Troubleshooting\n\nIf you were a registered warden prior to June 28, 2022 and you see this error\nwhen you fill out the registration form:\n\nIf your registration was merged but you still can't log in:\n\nIf you previously submitted findings, but your wallet is not supported by\nWalletConnect:\n\nCan I change the wallet address where I receive awards?\n\nCan I change the wallet address I log in with?\n\nCan I change my login method after I register?\n\nWhat if my wallet was hacked?\n\n"}
