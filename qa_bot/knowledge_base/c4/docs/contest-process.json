If you decide to move ahead with an audit, **the relevant code will be made public** at the time of your audit.\n\n  * After your code has been reviewed, Code4rena staff will contact you to iron out the details.\n\n  * Once we've received a deposit, we will finalize scheduling and begin to promote the audit.\n\n###\n\nDuring the audit\n\n  * Be prepared for a **code freeze for the duration of the audit** -- important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)\n\n  * We ask for a member or members of your engineering team to be available in the C4 Discord server in order to answer wardens' questions via DM.\n\n  * Please avoid discussing any issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.\n\n###\n\nAfter the audit\n\nYour work will play a role in developing a public report of the audit.\n\n  * Sponsors review findings, help identify duplicates, and provide comments as you confirm, acknowledge, or dispute wardens' findings.\n\n  * As your team works to mitigate issues, most sponsors will create a PR for each issue addressed in your codebase and link to it in the C4 finding issue and label the finding as resolved.\n\n[Roles - PreviousSponsors](/roles/sponsors)[Next \\-\nRolesJudges](/roles/judges)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nBefore the audit\n\nDuring the audit\n\nAfter the audit\n\n"}
