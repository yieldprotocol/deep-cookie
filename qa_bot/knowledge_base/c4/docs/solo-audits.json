These audits are performed by\none warden who reviews the sponsor's code and produces a report. ([Here's an\nexample](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-07-canto/) of a solo audit\nperformed by a Code4rena warden.)\n\n  * The process of booking a solo audit begins with a project team member clicking the \"Get a quote\" button on a warden's profile, and sharing scoping details with the Code4rena team.\n\n  * Code4rena staff will then consult with the warden and project team to firm up scoping, pricing, and dates.\n\n##\n\nBenefits to projects and wardens\n\n  * When a solo audit is booked via a warden's \"Available for hire\" function, both the warden and the project have direct access to Code4rena staff for assistance with:\n\n    * Legal agreements\n\n    * Scoping, pricing, and logistical planning\n\n    * Collection and disbursement of funds\n\n    * External accountability via a Code4rena Judge\n\n  * This top-tier support you'll receive from the Code4rena team is built into the solo audit booking model, at only 20% of the total audit fee.\n\n##\n\nHow can I opt in to solo audits?\n\nIf you are a Certified warden, you can make yourself available for solo audits\nby logging in to your [user account on the Code4rena\nwebsite](https://code4rena.com/account/edit-profile), and opting in to the\n\"Available for hire\" function on the Settings screen.\n\n[PreviousSubmission policy](/roles/wardens/submission-policy)[NextAuthenticate\nwith your wallet](/roles/wardens/warden-auth)\n\nLast modified 2mo ago\n\nOn this page\n\nBenefits to projects and wardens\n\nHow can I opt in to solo audits?\n\n"}
