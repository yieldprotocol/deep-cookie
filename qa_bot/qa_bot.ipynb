    "# CodeArena (C4) Question Answer bot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "- This notebook has the PoC work for a Question Answer bot using C4's knowledge bases.\n",
    "- The objective of the PoC is to prototype an LLM implementation that can accurately answer questions to their expectation and at the very least perform better than their current bot from [Mava](https://www.mava.app/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations from the usage of Mava\n",
    "- The platform offers Discord support management with ticketing and AI help bot features\n",
    "- For the AI help bot, the user is able to specify links to multiple knowledge sources that can be used for answering questions.\n",
    "- Based on C4's testing of the Mava bot in the private channel, the following stats were observed:-\n",
    "    - Total questions asked: 29\n",
    "    - Total questions mis-answered based on emoji reactions: 13\n",
    "    - Accuracy - ~55%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Bases\n",
    "Based on conversations with their team, the following knowledge bases were identified to be relevant and are the same ones that Mava is using:-\n",
    "- [Main Website](https://code4rena.com/)\n",
    "- [Docs](https://docs.code4rena.com/) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Approach\n",
    "- Crawl and scrape C4â€™s website and docs using Scrapy lib\n",
    "- Convert the html content to markdown format so that the model can better understand the context\n",
    "- Use LangChain lib to do the following:-\n",
    "    - Split the markdown header-separated sections into semantic chunks\n",
    "    - Embed and store the semantic chunks in an in-memory vector db\n",
    "    - Use the retrieval augmented functionality to answer the question"
